## About
The main objective of the project is to develop driver behavior detection software to help drivers stay safe. To achieve this, the system detects if the driver is drowsy, distracted, or not wearing a seat belt.

if both eyes of the driver are closed for a certain period of time, the system plays a loud beep to alert the driver and sends an email to the driver's relatives containing his photo, location, and an alert message.

 If the driver is not wearing a seat belt or becomes distracted, the system plays a loud beep only to alert drivers to drive safely and not endanger their lives and others.

 ### Driver Behavior Detection App has been created by a team of 5 students: 
* Yehia Hassanain Mohamed Mahmoud
* Fares Ahmed Abdeltawab Othman
* Mohamed Ahmed Abdelrahman Abdelaleem
* Youssef Sameh Roshdi Abdelhamed
* Khaled Galal Yehia kandil 


### Uses:
1. Flutter Framework (Dart)
2. Firebase, Cloud Firestore
3. Flask Api


### Features:
* Authentication (Login & Logout) and Registeration
* Live Detection for Driver Behavior
* If the driver is drowsy, the system will send an email to all of the driver's contacts
* User can add more contacts email
* Each user Each user can choose a sound for alert
### Datasets:
1. Seatbelt Dataset
The dataset has been sorted into two classes, one with 3500 training images of seat belts and the other with 3500 training images without seat belts. There are also 1600 images included in the dataset specifically for testing. You can access this dataset through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yehiahassanain/seat-belt2.
2. Distraction Dataset
This dataset comprises of 10 categories, with each having approximately 2400-3000 images for training purposes, as well as nearly 7K images that are unlabeled, dedicated for testing. After combining the categories for texting (left and right) and talking on the phone (left and right), the dataset is left with a total of 8 categories. You can access this dataset through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yehiahassanain/new-driver-behaviour22222.
