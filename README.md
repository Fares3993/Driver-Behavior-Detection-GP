## About
The main objective of the project is to develop driver behavior detection software to help drivers stay safe. To achieve this, the system detects if the driver is drowsy, distracted, or not wearing a seat belt.

if both eyes of the driver are closed for a certain period of time, the system plays a loud beep to alert the driver and sends an email to the driver's relatives containing his photo, location, and an alert message.

 If the driver is not wearing a seat belt or becomes distracted, the system plays a loud beep only to alert drivers to drive safely and not endanger their lives and others.
